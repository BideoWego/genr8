Genr8
=====

![Generator](genr8.jpg)


Genr8 is a [DIY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_it_yourself) generator written in Bash. Use it to help you generate boilerplate for your applications.


## Installation

1. Clone the repo anywhere on your machine
    - **Note** If you want to be able to create your own generators and merge upstream updates, fork and clone the repo.
1. Create a symlink with `ln -s /path/to/genr8/index.sh /usr/local/bin/genr8`


## The Express Generator

Genr8 comes with a single generator for [Express](https://expressjs.com) applications.

```

Please specify a generator from the list:
 express
```


### Running the Generator

Running `$ genr8 express` will start the generator. It will create boilerplate files and folders for an Express application with [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com) as the view engine.


### Generated Files and Folders

Here is a quick outline of what the generator creates and the purpose in mind for each file and folder.

* `config/` - A place to put config files for connecting to databases etc...
* `helpers/` - A directory in which files suffixed with `_helper.js` will be automatically loaded. Helper functions in these files will be available in views. Comes with some common helpers out of the box
* `lib/` - Put your own libraries here
* `models/` - Model files and folders
* `public/` - Express uses this folder to serve static assets
* `routers/` - Router files go here
* `views/` - A place to put view templates. Comes populated with a default layout, welcome page and 500 error page
* `.gitignore` - Ignores `node_modules/` and `npm-debug.log` by default. Add files for Git to ignore here
* `app.js` - The main Express application file
* `repl.js` - A REPL for you to test drive your code. Require modules, libraries etc... here to play around and test them out


## Creating Generators

If you wish to create a generator:

1. Create a folder in the `genr8/` directory
1. Add an `index.sh` file in which to put the commands/script for your generator
1. Run `$ genr8` and you should see the name of that folder added to the list of available generators

Open the `express/` folder to see an example of how a generator is created.

Please specify a generator from the list:
 express
 my_awesome_generator
```

**NOTE** when creating your own generators with a symlinked executable you'll need to get the path to the original `genr8/` folder to access your boilerplate. You can do so with:

```bash
# /usr/local/bin/genr8

DIR=$(dirname $(readlink $(which genr8)))
#=> /path/to/cloned/genr8/repo/
```


## TODOs [Unreleased]

- Add helpers similar to Rails http://api.rubyonrails.org/ for the following:
    - Asset tag/URL helpers
    - Date
    - Debug
    - Number
    - Sanitize
    - Text
- Tests for generated application (Mocha or Jasmine)
